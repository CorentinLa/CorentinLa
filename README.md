## Hello, I tried to assemble some university (ENSTA) projects to which I participated and was able to find.

Some ENSTA Projects done in team are available in my ["Stars" tab](https://github.com/CorentinLa?tab=stars).

Here are a few ENSTA projects/labs (TD) that may be useful for future students :
